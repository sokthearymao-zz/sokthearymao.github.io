## My Personal Blog

### DISCLAIMER
I am still understanding Jekyll, so a majority of what I say may be incorrect.
Still need to fix format.

### Introduction

-- Built with Jekyll Bootstrap; custom tempalte based off poole. 
Grab it here https://github.com/poole/poole if interested or fork mine.
Takes a little tweaking to get your head wrapped around it, but all your 
pages are static files and light-weight. All your posts are written in markdown.
Here is the link for Markdown basics https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/

-- _includes folder contains all extensions of the blog (still not quite sure what everything does)

-- _layouts folder contains template structure of how the pages work

-- _posts folder contains all of your posts written in markdown (make sure to save your files as .md)

-- about folder contains an index.html for the corresponding page (about)

-- assets folder contains all images, icons, graphics etc you would like to put on your blog

-- css folder contains all the stylesheets that corresponds to the _layouts folder pages

-- cv folder contains an index.html for the the corresponding page (curriculum vitae)

-- portfolio folder contains an index.html for the corresponding page (portfolio); can put other projects here

-- short_fiction folder contains an index.html for the corresponding page (short fiction)

-- .gitattributes, gitignore, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, _config.yml files; needed for jekyll to work (will figure out how it all works later in better detail)

-- index.html (I believe this controls the overall layouts and blog pagination; will need more research on it)
